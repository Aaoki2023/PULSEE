# NQR/NMR Simulation Software

## Author: Davide Candoli

This project consists of a software which simulates a typical nuclear quadrupole/magnetic resonance experiment on a solid state sample, describing the dynamics of nuclear spins in condensed matter under the effect of a static magnetic field and the application of an electromagnetic pulse.
